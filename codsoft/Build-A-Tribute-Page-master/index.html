			<ul class="font" style="text-align: justify;">
				<br>
				<li><b>1910</b> - Mother Terasa was born 26 August 1910,Üsküp, Kosovo vilayet, Ottoman Empire.Mother Teresa was an Albanian-Indian Catholic nun and the founder of the Missionaries of Charity.</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>1928</b> - Mother Teresa was in her early years when she became fascinated by stories of the lives of missionaries and their service in Bengal; by age 12, she was convinced that she should commit herself to religious life.Her resolve strengthened on 15 August 1928 as she prayed at the shrine of the Black Madonna of Vitina-Letnice, where she often went on pilgrimages</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>1931</b> - She arrived in India in 1929 and began her novitiate in Darjeeling, in the lower Himalayas,where she learned Bengali and taught at St. Teresa's School near her convent.She took her first religious vows on 24 May 1931. She chose to be named after Thérèse de Lisieux, the patron saint of missionaries because a nun in the convent had already chosen that name, she opted for its Spanish spelling of Teresa.</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>1937</b> - She arrived in India in 1929 and began her novitiate in Darjeeling, in the lower Himalayas,where she learned Bengali and taught at St. Teresa's School near her convent.She took her first religious vows on 24 May 1931. She chose to be named after Thérèse de Lisieux, the patron saint of missionaries because a nun in the convent had already chosen that name, she opted for its Spanish spelling of Teresa.</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>1946</b> - She arrived in India in 1929 and began her novitiate in Darjeeling, in the lower Himalayas,where she learned Bengali and taught at St. Teresa's School near her convent.She took her first religious vows on 24 May 1931. She chose to be named after Thérèse de Lisieux, the patron saint of missionaries because a nun in the convent had already chosen that name, she opted for its Spanish spelling of Teresa.</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>1948</b> - She began missionary work with the poor in 1948,replacing her traditional Loreto habit with a simple, white cotton sari with a blue border. Mother Teresa adopted Indian citizenship, spent several months in Patna to receive basic medical training at Holy Family Hospital and ventured into the slums.She founded a school in Motijhil, Calcutta, before she began tending to the poor and hungry.At the beginning of 1949, Mother Teresa was joined in her effort by a group of young women, and she laid the foundation for a new religious community helping the "poorest among the poor".</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>1950</b> - On 7 October 1950, Mother Teresa received Vatican permission for the diocesan congregation, which would become the Missionaries of Charity.In her words, it would care for "the hungry, the naked, the homeless, the crippled, the blind, the lepers, all those people who feel unwanted, unloved, uncared for throughout society, people that have become a burden to the society and are shunned by everyone".</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>1952</b> - In 1952, Mother Teresa opened her first hospice with help from Calcutta officials. She converted an abandoned Hindu temple into the Kalighat Home for the Dying, free for the poor, and renamed it Kalighat, the Home of the Pure Heart (Nirmal Hriday).Those brought to the home received medical attention and the opportunity to die with dignity in accordance with their faith: Muslims were to read the Quran, Hindus received water from the Ganges, and Catholics received extreme unction."A beautiful death", Mother Teresa said, "is for people who lived like animals to die like angels—loved and wanted.".</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>1960</b> - The congregation began to attract recruits and donations, and by the 1960s it had opened hospices, orphanages and leper houses throughout India. Mother Teresa then expanded the congregation abroad, opening a house in Venezuela in 1965 with five sisters.Houses followed in Italy (Rome), Tanzania and Austria in 1968, and, during the 1970s, the congregation opened houses and foundations in the United States and dozens of countries in Asia, Africa and Europe.</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>1963</b> -The Missionaries of Charity Brothers was founded in 1963, and a contemplative branch of the Sisters followed in 1976. Lay Catholics and non-Catholics were enrolled in the Co-Workers of Mother Teresa, the Sick and Suffering Co-Workers, and the Lay Missionaries of Charity. Responding to requests by many priests, in 1981, Mother Teresa founded the Corpus Christi Movement for Priests and with Joseph Langford founded the Missionaries of Charity Fathers in 1984 to combine the vocational aims of the Missionaries of Charity with the resources of the priesthood</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>1997</b> - By 1997, the 13-member Calcutta congregation had grown to more than 4,000 sisters who managed orphanages, AIDS hospices and charity centres worldwide, caring for refugees, the blind, the disabled, the aged, alcoholics, the poor and homeless and victims of floods, epidemics and famine.By 2007, the Missionaries of Charity numbered about 450 brothers and 5,000 sisters worldwide, operating 600 missions, schools and shelters in 120 countries.</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>1997</b> - In April 1996, Mother Teresa fell, breaking her collarbone, and four months later she had malaria and heart failure. Although she underwent heart surgery, her health was clearly declining. According to the Archbishop of Calcutta Henry Sebastian D'Souza, he ordered a priest to perform an exorcism (with her permission) when she was first hospitalised with cardiac problems because he thought she might be under attack by the devil.On 13 March 1997, Mother Teresa resigned as head of the Missionaries of Charity. She died on 5 September.</li>
